This repository contains 2 files: hw0_stack.c and hw0_pc.c

each were compiled on linux using the following commands:

gcc -o stack hw0_stack.c
./stack

gcc -o prod_cons hw0_pc.c
./prod_cons


The stack program uses an array data structure, along with push() and pop() functions for removing values from the array respectively. A stack is a last in first out data structure (LIFO) and this behavior is 
accomplished through the use of the push() and pop() functions to push a value to the top of the stack or pop a value off of the top of the stack.
